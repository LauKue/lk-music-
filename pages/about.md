## About the Collection

In December of 2019, three of my Christmas presents were tickets to local musical productions such as Hamilton, Waitress, and Wicked. These had been a long time coming and finally, now that I was finishing high school, it looked like all of the stars were lining up to finally see these productions. Unfortunately, just a few months later, all of our plans went awry. For all of 2020 and most of 2021, like many others, I was unable to attend events and experience community. However, the University of Northern Iowa began to settle back in to their rhythm. Starting in September of 2021, I was invited by my neighbors at Hagemann Hall to go to a football game together. My favorite part was watching the marching band. And like that, a light-swtch was flipped. I made a promise to myself to try and get to whatever musical events I could access safely.

Those next two years, admittedly, I didn't get to many things. However, by the time I moved into my junior year housing with my new roommates, UNI had gotten back into its groove. There was a wonderful selection of music events! And I went to several mod band performances, a class that two of my roommates and a friend of ours particpated in to form their own band. 

In 2024, I had graduated. I had so much new free time and (it seemed like) plenty of disposable income. At that point, I was fixed on making memories. I knew this was the best chance I had to actually go to things and drive around when I didn't have school and I had people willing to go with me. I don't regret it for a moment. I leaned into musicals, bands, and orchestras like never before.

In 2025, I've already gone to so many things with plans on hitting plenty more. Already, barely two weeks after inputting this data, I've already seen two more orchestra performances to support my friends playing at the Ballantyne Auditorium in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It's safe to say that I have more than made up for what I lost from COVID, and I've learned to appreciate being in the moment so much more.
